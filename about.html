 <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Adjoa Aboli and this is my first semester back since graduating college back in 2014. I attended Cal State Dominguez Hills and obtain a BS in Criminal Justice. Being that this is my first semester back since then, I am currently going back to school for a certificate in Computer Science.  I found an interest in IT because I have been working in IT for the past three years. I am eager to learn more about IT and get more basic down.</p>
